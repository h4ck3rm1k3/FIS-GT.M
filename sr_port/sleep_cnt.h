/* Note: GT.M code *MUST*NOT* make use of the sleep() function because use of the sleep() function
   causes problems with GT.M's timers on some platforms. Specifically, the sleep() function
   causes the SIGARLM handler to be silently deleted on Solaris systems (through Solaris 9 at least).
   This leads to lost timer pops and has the potential for system hangs. The proper long sleep mechanism
   is hiber_start which can be accessed through the LONG_SLEEP macro defined in mdef.h.
