	 * time routine (__tzset() in linux) due to the call to dollarh() below, we then end up in generic_signal_handler() which
	 * seems to do a call to syslog() which in turn invokes a system time routine (__tz_convert() in linux) which seems to
	 * get suspended presumably waiting for the same interlock that __tzset() has already obtained. a fix for rollback to
	 * work around this is to block any signals that can be sent externally while it is doing time system calls.
	 * hence the blocking of SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGTSTP, SIGCONT (through the use of block_sigsent) before doing
	 * the call to dollarh() [C9D06-002271].
